# Pretext book project for CS 2

This book is a PreText adaptation of Java for Python Programmers (https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/java4python) by Brad Miller, CS Awesome by Beryl Hoffman (https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/csawesome) and Java, Java, Java: Object-Oriented Problem Solving, 2024E by Ralph Morelli, Ralph Walde, Beryl Hoffman, and David G. Cooper (https://github.com/ram8647/javajavajava).

In addition to helping students transition from Python to Java, this book is intended to facilitate their shift from procedural and functional programming to object-oriented programming. We introduce a structured design recipe for programming (https://htdp.org), specifically tailored to the principles and practices of object-oriented development.

The book is specifically designed for students enrolled in the Introduction to Computer Science II course at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (http://charlotte.edu/). This edition, released for the Spring 2025 semester, will continue to evolve in during the semester to better highlight the interconnections between computational thinking and object-oriented programming concepts.
