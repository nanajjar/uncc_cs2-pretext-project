    <p> 
        Developing software goes beyond just writing code; it involves careful planning, design,
        collaboration, and problem-solving. To streamline these processes and ensure the quality and
        maintainability of code, developers rely on a variety of tools. This chapter introduces
        essential software development tools and techniques, including: <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software like IntelliJ IDEA or
        Eclipse that simplifies coding, testing, and project management.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Unified Modeling Language (UML): A standardized way to visualize and design
        software systems.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Version Control Systems (VCS): Tools like Git for managing changes to code and
        collaborating with others.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        Mastering these tools is key to becoming a proficient programmer and navigating the
        complexities of real-world software development.
