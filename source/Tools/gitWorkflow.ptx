  </p>

  <p>
    Here's a simplified version of how Git fits into the development cycle:

    </p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
  <p>
Clone the repository to your local machine.

  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Make changes in your working directory.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Stage the changes you want to include in your next commit.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Push your commit to the remote repository.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Pull updates from the remote repository to stay in sync with your team.
  </p>
</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Version Control Best Practices

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Commit Early, Commit Often: Frequent commits with meaningful messages make it easier to track progress and debug issues.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use Branches: Keep your main branch stable and use feature branches for new work.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Pull Before You Push: Always get the latest version of the code before uploading your own changes to avoid conflicts.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Write Clear Commit Messages: Summarize what was changed and why in a concise way.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Mastering version control with Git is a vital skill for modern software developers. It not only makes individual work more manageable but also enables seamless collaboration in team-based projectsâ€”whether in class or in the professional world.
