  <title>Version Control Systems (VCS)</title>

  <p>
    As software projects grow in size and complexity, keeping track of changes, coordinating teamwork, and preventing loss of work becomes increasingly important. 
    Version Control Systems (VCS) provide a structured way to manage these challenges. 
    They track every change made to a codebase, who made it, when, and why—allowing developers to revisit previous versions, collaborate more effectively, and recover from mistakes.

<p>
Why Use Version Control?
</p>

<p>Version control helps with:
<ul>
<li> 
History Tracking: You can review the history of a project, see what changed, and revert to earlier versions if necessary.
</li>
<li>
Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work.
</li>
<li>
Branching and Merging: Developers can create branches to work on features independently, then merge them back into the main project once complete.
</li>

<li>
Backup: A central repository (often in the cloud) serves as a backup of the project, protecting against data loss.
</li>
</ul>
