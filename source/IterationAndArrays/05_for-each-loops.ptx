  <title>For–Each Loops: Syntactic Sugar for Iteration</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous section, we built a custom iteration class (<c>MyIterator</c>) that
      encapsulated an array and a current index—essentially acting as a "bookmark" into the data.
      That approach frees us from manually writing <c>for</c> loops (with index checks) everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, imagine if you could simply hand off your array to a built-in mechanism that
      knows how to iterate without exposing the raw index. In Java, the enhanced <c>for</c> loop
      (often called the for–each loop) provides exactly this convenience. It's a form of
      <term>syntactic sugar</term>—a concise way to perform iteration without writing out all
      the loop–control details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal in this section is to show you how to use the for–each loop with arrays, compare
      its behavior to the iteration logic you already built, and discuss subtle pitfalls to
      watch out for. Later, as you learn about interfaces and inheritance, you'll see how to
      adapt your custom classes so that they plug directly into the for–each syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Expectations:</term> By the end of this section, you will be able to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Use the enhanced <c>for</c> loop to iterate over arrays succinctly</p></li>
      <li><p>Recognize that for–each loops hide index details (like <c>hasNext()</c>, <c>next()</c> calls)</p></li>
      <li><p>Explain common pitfalls and limitations of for–each loops</p></li>
      <li><p>Relate this "syntactic sugar" back to our earlier design of <c>MyIterator</c></p></li>

  <subsection xml:id="using-foreach-with-arrays">
    <title>Using For–Each Loops with Arrays</title>
    <p>
      Consider a simple array of integers. Traditionally, you might iterate like this:
    </p>
    <program language="java">
      <input>
int[] numbers = {5, 10, 15, 20};
for (int i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println("Index " + i + ": " + numbers[i]);
}
      </input>
    </program>

    <p>
      In a for–each loop, we can omit the manual index management:
    </p>
    <program language="java">
      <input>
int[] numbers = {5, 10, 15, 20};
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println("Number: " + num);
}
      </input>
    </program>

    <p>
      The syntax <c>for (int num : numbers)</c> is short for “Loop over each element of <c>numbers</c>, 
      assign it to <c>num</c>, then run the body.” It's the same fundamental iteration—just no
      explicit index variable or <c>length</c> checks. Think of it like Java calling <c>hasNext()</c>
      and <c>next()</c> behind the scenes for each element.
    </p>

    <p>
      **Visual Concept**: 
    </p>
    <program language="text">
Numbers array:   [  5  |  10  |  15  |  20  ]
Indices:           0      1      2      3
For–each loop =>  first pass: num=5
                  second pass: num=10
                  third pass: num=15
                  fourth pass: num=20
    </program>

    <p>
      Each iteration, <c>num</c> becomes one element of <c>numbers</c>. Once it exhausts the
      array, the loop ends automatically—no extra condition or index update required.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="pitfalls-and-limitations">
    <title>Common Pitfalls &amp; Limitations</title>
    <p>
      The for–each loop is convenient, but let's highlight where it can trip you up:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>No Direct Index Access</strong>:
        You can't easily figure out <em>which</em> index you're on inside the loop. If you need
        to know “am I on the 5th element?” or “access <c>i+1</c>,” you must revert to a standard
        <c>for</c> loop or maintain a separate counter. 
        <p><em>Example:</em> <c>for(int x : arr)</c> doesn't let you do <c>arr[i+1]</c>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Easy Way to Remove/Insert</strong>:
        Because arrays are fixed-size and for–each doesn't provide the index, you can't remove
        or insert elements mid-loop (like you might in a dynamic list). You can modify the
        element values themselves, but you can't skip or reorder them easily using for–each.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Accidental Shadowing or Reassignment</strong>:
        Remember that <c>num</c> in <c>for (int num : numbers)</c> is a separate variable. If you
        reassign <c>num</c> inside the loop, it won't affect <c>numbers</c>. 
        <p><em>Example:</em> 
        <code>for (int x : arr) { x = 99; }</code> doesn't actually set <c>arr[anything]</c> to 99;
        you're merely changing the local variable <c>x</c>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Breaking Early or Skipping Elements</strong>:
        If you need to exit after you find a certain element, you can do so with a
        <c>break</c> inside the for–each body—but skipping certain indices or iterating in reverse
        is better handled by a classic <c>for</c> loop or a <c>while</c>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Overall, for–each loops excel at “visit every element in a forward direction with minimal fuss.”
      If you want more control—like indexing, reordering, or partial iteration—then a classic
      <c>for</c> or <c>while</c> might be better. 
    </p>
  </subsection>


  <subsection xml:id="connecting-foreach-to-custom-iterator">
    <title>Relating For–Each to Our <c>MyIterator</c> Class</title>
    <p>
      Recall that our <c>MyIterator</c> class had methods <c>hasNext()</c> and <c>next()</c> to
      manage iteration. Java's for–each loop uses a similar idea but in a more official way:
    </p>
    <p>
      - If a class implements <c>Iterable</c>&lt;T&gt;, it must provide 
        <c>public Iterator&lt;T&gt; iterator()</c>.  
      - That <c>Iterator&lt;T&gt;</c> must have <c>boolean hasNext()</c> and <c>T next()</c>.  
      - Then <c>for (T item : iterableObject)</c> automatically calls <c>hasNext()</c> / <c>next()</c>
        behind the scenes for each item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our <c>MyIterator</c> is close to that pattern. Later, once we learn about interfaces and
      generics, we can rework <c>MyIterator</c> to <em>formally</em> implement 
      <c>Iterator&lt;Integer&gt;</c>. We could also create a separate class that implements
      <c>Iterable&lt;Integer&gt;</c> (returning a new <c>MyIterator</c> in its <c>iterator()</c>
      method). Then for–each would just “magically” work. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the for–each loop is essentially “syntactic sugar” for iterators, as you can see in
      the pseudo-code below:
    </p>
    <program language="java">
      <input>
// Pseudo-code of what for (T item : collection) is doing:
Iterator&lt;T&gt; it = collection.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    T item = it.next();
    // loop body
}
      </input>
    </program>
    <p>
      Because our <c>MyIterator</c> was built from first principles, you have a deeper
      appreciation for what happens under the hood!

  <subsection xml:id="foreach-advanced-example">
    <title>Example: Summing Even Values &amp; Using <c>break</c></title>
    <p>
      Let's show a slightly more advanced for–each example—summing only the <em>first few even values</em>.
      Suppose we have:
    </p>
    <program language="java">
      <input>
int[] data = {2, 11, 4, 6, 9, 2};
int totalEven = 0;

for (int val : data) {
    if (val % 2 == 0) {
        totalEven += val;
    }
    // If we only want to sum the first 3 array elements total:
    // This won't help if we need to stop after the 3rd element. 
    // for-each doesn't give an index. 
}
System.out.println("Sum of even numbers: " + totalEven);
      </input>
    </program>
    <p>
      That sums all even numbers <c>(2 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 14)</c>. However, if we needed to stop after
      the 3rd element in the array or skip certain positions, we'd realize for–each can't easily
      do that. We'd have to add an external counter or break logic:
    </p>
    <program language="java">
      <input>
int count = 0;
int sumEvens = 0;
for (int val : data) {
    sumEvens += (val % 2 == 0) ? val : 0;
    count++;
    if (count == 3) { 
       break; // we processed 3 elements, let's stop
    }
}
System.out.println("Sum of even numbers in the FIRST 3 elements: " + sumEvens);
      </input>
    </program>
    <p>
      That works but starts feeling awkward. If you need to break frequently or refer to indexes,
      a classic <c>for</c> loop is often simpler. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> For–each loops are clean and short for “iterate all elements,” 
      but less flexible when partial iteration or index-based operations are required.

  <!-- SUMMARY -->
  <subsection xml:id="summary-foreach">
    <title>Summary: For–Each Loops</title>
    <p>
      In this section, we explored the enhanced <c>for</c> loop—a concise, intuitive way
      to iterate over arrays. We learned that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>The for–each loop automatically retrieves each element without needing an index variable or boundary checks.</p></li>
      <li><p>It's <term>syntactic sugar</term> that conceals the repeated logic of <c>hasNext()</c> and <c>next()</c> calls.</p></li>
      <li><p>Our custom iterator design parallels how for–each loops work under the hood.</p></li>
      <li><p>For–each loops are best for “visit every element, forward only,” with minimal fuss. If you need random access, skipping, or partial iteration, you might revert to a traditional loop.</p></li>
      <li><p>Reassigning the loop variable in a for–each does not alter the array. To <em>modify</em> array elements, you must use an indexed loop.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With this knowledge, you can write cleaner, more expressive loops in your Java programs
      when you just need to process each element. 
      In the next chapter, we'll delve deeper into classes and objects (including interfaces and
      inheritance) and see how the standard <c>Iterator</c> and <c>Iterable</c> interfaces power
      Java's for–each loop across various collections—beyond just arrays.
