  <title>Processing Data Efficiently</title>

  <p>
  Iteration is a fundamental concept in programming, allowing us to repeat actions efficiently and process collections of data. 
Java provides several structured ways to handle iteration, ranging from basic loops to more advanced techniques that improve code readability and maintainability.
</p>
<p>
In this chapter, we'll start with fundamental looping constructs, learning how to control repetition effectively. 
As we progress, we'll explore how Java structures iteration through collections, introducing the concept of iterators and how they work behind the scenes. 
Along the way, we'll see how Java simplifies iteration with built-in features, making our code more concise and expressive.
</p>
<p>
By understanding these concepts, you'll be able to write cleaner, more efficient programs that handle repeated actions and data traversal with ease. 
This foundation will also prepare you for working with more complex data structures and patterns in future programming tasks.

        <p>Design and implement a simple iterator to manage iteration manually.</p></li>
 <li>
        <p>Use the for-each loop to simplify iteration and understand how it works behind the scenes.</p></li>
 <li>
        <p>Develop an awareness of how Java's iteration mechanisms are formalized through interfaces like <c>Iterator&lt;T&gt;</c> and <c>Iterable&lt;T&gt;</c>, setting the stage for future learning on object-oriented design.</p></li>
