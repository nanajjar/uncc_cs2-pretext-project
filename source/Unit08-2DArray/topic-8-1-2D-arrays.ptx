        <title>Two-dimensional (2D) Arrays</title>
        <p>We have only worked with one-dimensional arrays so far, which have a single row of elements. But in the real world, data is often represented in a two-dimensional table with rows and columns. Programming languages can also represent arrays this way with multiple dimensions. A two-dimensional (2D) array has rows and columns. A 2D array in Java is actually an array of arrays.</p>
