    <title>Overview and Objectives</title>
    <p>
      In Section 1, we saw how Audrey's lack of data definitions led to confusion when her music library 
      needed new features. But even with clear data definitions, we still need a way to communicate what 
      our functions or methods do with that data.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we'll continue Audrey's story as she learns why documenting what a function promises 
      (and what constraints it has) is just as crucial as documenting data structure. We'll discover how 
      tools like docstrings in Python can make these "contracts" explicit and checkable.
    </p>

    <objectives>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><em>Recognize</em> that functions need clear "contracts" to prevent misuse and confusion</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><em>Write</em> method signatures that specify inputs, outputs, and key constraints</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><em>Create</em> purpose statements that explain what a function does (and doesn't do)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><em>Use</em> Python's docstrings to document function contracts effectively</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
  </subsection>

  <!-- The Problem -->
  <subsection xml:id="the-communication-breakdown">
    <title>A Communication Breakdown</title>
    <p>
      After learning about data definitions, Audrey felt more confident. Each song was now clearly defined 
      as [title, rating, play_count] with specific rules about valid values. Excited to share her progress, 
      she showed her code to her study group.
    </p>

    <listing xml:id="shared-function">
      <program language="python">
        def update_rating(library, song_title, new_rating):
            for entry in library:
                if entry[0] == song_title:
                    entry[1] = new_rating
                    return
      </program>
    </listing>

    <p>Her friend Mai tried using the function:</p>

    <listing>
      <program language="python">
        # Mai's attempt
        songs = [["Hey Jude", 4, 10]]
        result = update_rating(songs, "Hey Jude", 5)
        print(f"Update succeeded: {result}")  # Prints: Update succeeded: None
        
        # Later...
        update_rating(None, "Hey Jude", 5)   # Crashes! 
        update_rating(songs, "Hey Jude", 10)  # Sets rating to 10 (invalid!)
        update_rating([], "", -1)            # Silently does nothing
      </program>
    </listing>

    <p>"Your function is broken!" Mai said. "It returns None even when it works, crashes sometimes, 
       and doesn't tell me if the song wasn't found!"</p>
       
    <p>Audrey protested: "But it works fine for me! I always check the library after calling it, 
       and I know not to pass None or invalid ratings..."</p>

    <p>They were both right—and both wrong. The function worked exactly as Audrey intended, but 
       she'd never explicitly stated those intentions. She'd written code that made sense to her 
       but left others guessing about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What valid values can new_rating take?</li>
      <li>Can library be None or empty?</li>
      <li>How do we know if the update succeeded?</li>
      <li>Should it warn us if song_title isn't found?</li>
    </ul>
  </subsection>

  <!-- Modify transition to discovering-contracts section -->
  <subsection xml:id="discovering-contracts">
    <title>From Confusion to Clarity</title>
    <p>
      After the miscommunication, Mai and Audrey met at the campus coffee shop. Instead of arguing about 
      who was right, they decided to write down exactly what they each thought the function should do.
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p><alert>Mai:</alert> "Let me write down what confused me when I tried using your function..."</p>
      <p><em>Mai writes on a napkin:</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Can I pass an empty library?</li>
          <li>What happens if the song isn't found?</li>
          <li>How do I know if the update worked?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><alert>Audrey:</alert> "Oh! I see the problem. I had all these rules in my head, but I never 
         wrote them down. Like, ratings have to be 1-5..."</p>
      <p><alert>Mai:</alert> "Wait, they do? That would've been good to know before I tried setting it to 10!"</p>
      <p><alert>Audrey:</alert> "Right... and the library can't be None, and song titles can't be empty..."</p>
      <p><alert>Mai:</alert> "This is exactly what I needed to know! We should document all of this."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Their conversation revealed four key parts of any function contract:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Preconditions:</em> What must be true about the inputs? (e.g., rating must be 1-5)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Input Types:</em> What kind of data can each parameter accept?</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Return Value:</em> What does success or failure look like?</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Error Cases:</em> What happens when things go wrong?</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Mai grabbed another napkin and started organizing their thoughts:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <title>Mai's Napkin Notes</title>
      <p>update_rating needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Inputs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>library: must be a non-empty list of songs</p></li>
            <li><p>song_title: must be a non-empty string</p></li>
            <li><p>new_rating: must be an int from 1 to 5</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>Output: should tell us if it worked (True/False?)</p></li>
        <li><p>Errors: raise ValueError for bad inputs</p></li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="from-discussion-to-docs">
    <title>Turning Coffee Shop Notes into Code</title>
    <p>
      Back at their dorm, Audrey and Mai turned their napkin notes into Python code. They knew that
      Python has special "docstrings" - documentation strings that explain what functions do.
    </p>

    <p>Their first attempt looked promising, but they weren't sure about the best format:</p>

    <listing>
      <program language="python">
        def update_rating(library, song_title, new_rating):
            """
            Updates a song's rating. The song must exist in the library.
            
            We require:
            - library is a non-None, non-empty list of songs
            - song_title is a non-empty string
            - new_rating is an int between 1 and 5
            
            Returns True if found and updated, False if song not found.
            Raises ValueError for invalid inputs.
            """
            if library is None or len(library) == 0:
                raise ValueError("Library cannot be None or empty")
            if not song_title:  # Catches empty strings
                raise ValueError("Song title cannot be empty")
            if not (1 &lt;= new_rating &lt;= 5):
                raise ValueError("Rating must be 1-5")
            # ... rest of implementation ...
      </program>
    </listing>

    <p>
      This was much better! Now anyone reading the function would know:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exactly what inputs are valid (and invalid)</li>
      <li>What the function promises to return</li>
      <li>When and why it might raise errors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      But Mai noticed something: "This is good, but it's still kind of... informal? Like, we're just
      writing paragraphs. Is there a more standardized way to document functions in Python?"
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="informal-to-formal">
    <title>Making Documentation More Structured</title>
    <p>
      Before looking at Python's formal documentation tools, let's practice writing a contract

              result = []
              for song in library:
                  if song[1] >= 4:
                      result.append(song[0])
              return result

  <!-- Modify why-signature-purpose introduction -->
  <subsection xml:id="why-signature-purpose">
    <title>Writing Clear Contracts with Python</title>
    <p>
      Remember how Audrey and Mai discovered they needed to specify:
      <ul>
        <li>What kinds of inputs are valid</li>
        <li>What the function promises to do</li>
        <li>What happens when things go wrong</li>
      </ul>
      Python provides two main tools for this: <alert>method signatures</alert> with type hints
      and <alert>purpose statements</alert> in docstrings. Together, these form a clear contract
      between the function and its users.
    </p>
    <p> A <alert>method signature</alert> is more than just “function name + parameters.” It's a
      compact way to state the function's inputs, outputs, and sometimes exceptions or error
      conditions. Combined with a <alert>purpose statement</alert> (a one- or two-sentence
      explanation of the function's job), you get a “mini contract” that aligns everyone's
      expectations. </p>

    <subsubsection xml:id="living-documentation">
      <title>A Form of Living Documentation</title>
      <p>
        Once written, these signatures and purpose statements become living documentation. If you
        decide
        to change the function's behavior—like refusing to update a rating if the new value is out
        of
        [1..5]—you can update the contract accordingly. Anyone reading the code can see exactly
        what's
        expected, without guessing or searching for hidden assumptions.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection xml:id="better-testing-later">
      <title>Enabling Better Testing (Later Steps)</title>
      <p>
        These contracts also guide test creation. Step 4 of the design recipe (Examples &amp; Tests)
        becomes
        much clearer when we know each function's inputs, outputs, and constraints. We can
        systematically
        test valid and invalid ratings, missing song titles, etc., rather than discovering them “by
        accident”
        during frantic debugging.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
  </subsection>

  <!-- Update method-signature-python introduction -->
  <subsection xml:id="method-signature-python">
    <title>From Notes to Professional Documentation</title>
    <p>
      After some research, Mai discovered that professional Python developers use a combination of
      two tools to write clear contracts: <em>type hints</em> and structured <em>docstrings</em>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><alert>Mai:</alert> "Look what I found! We can actually tell Python what types our function expects:"</p>
      <program language="python">
        def update_rating(library: list, song_title: str, new_rating: int) -> bool:
      </program>
      <p><alert>Audrey:</alert> "That's cool! So anyone can see that new_rating must be an integer?"</p>
      <p><alert>Mai:</alert> "Exactly! And the -> bool means it returns True or False."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Excited by this discovery, they refined their documentation further:</p>

    <listing>
      <program language="python">
        def update_rating(library: list, song_title: str, new_rating: int) -> bool:
            """
            Updates the rating for a song in the music library.

            Args:
                library: A list of songs, each [title, rating, play_count].
                        Cannot be None or empty.
                song_title: The title to search for. Must be non-empty.
                new_rating: New rating value, must be in range [1..5].

            Returns:
                True if the song was found and updated, False otherwise.

            Raises:
                ValueError: If any inputs violate their constraints.

            Example:
                >>> songs = [["Hey Jude", 3, 10]]
                >>> update_rating(songs, "Hey Jude", 4)
                True
                >>> update_rating(songs, "Unknown Song", 4)

            """
            # Implementation will come later...
            pass
      </program>
    </listing>

    <p>This version had several advantages over their coffee-shop notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Type hints (<c>list</c>, <c>str</c>, <c>int</c>) catch type mismatches early</li>
      <li>Structured sections (Args, Returns, Raises) make the contract easy to scan</li>
      <li>Example usage shows exactly how the function should behave</li>

        </li>
        <li>

      With clear method signatures and purpose statements in place, we're ready for the next step: 
      writing examples and tests <em>before</em> implementation. This "test-first" approach ensures 
      our contract is complete and unambiguous.

        <ul>
          <li>Takes a list of student names and their grades</li>
          <li>Returns a list of names of students who passed (grade &gt;= 60)</li>
          <li>Handles empty lists and invalid grades appropriately</li>
