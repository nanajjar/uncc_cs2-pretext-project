    <title>Overview and Objectives</title>
    <p>
      This chapter introduces the importance of <em>data design</em> in any program. Students
      often jump straight into coding—tackling a problem by writing loops, conditionals,
      or function calls—without stopping to clarify exactly what data they’ll process and
      how it’s structured. This leads to hidden confusion or brittle “quick fixes” that
      eventually fail when requirements change.
    </p>
    <p> We follow the story of <strong>Audrey</strong>, a music lover who naively starts storing her
      favorite songs in code. Each time she adds a new feature, unplanned changes to her data break
      old parts of the program. By exploring her incremental fiasco, we’ll see why it’s crucial to
      <em>explicitly design</em> and <em>document</em> your data before (and during) coding—even if it seems
      like “extra work.” </p>
    <p> After reading this chapter, you should be able to: <ul>
        <li>Explain why “just start coding” can lead to maintenance headaches and silent bugs.</li>
        <li>Articulate that all programs transform <em>input data</em> into <em>output data</em>,
      and thus a clear data specification is vital.</li>
        <li>Recognize that <em>data definitions</em> (written “blueprints” of how data is structured)
      safeguard against accidental changes or misunderstandings.</li>
        <li>Appreciate how typed languages like Java can later help <em>enforce</em> these
      definitions automatically, rather than relying only on the programmer’s discipline.</li>

    <title>Audrey’s Journey</title>

    <!-- 2.1. Initial Goal -->
    <subsection xml:id="initial-goal">
      <title>1. The Music App Dream</title>
      <p>Meet Audrey, a CS student who loves music and programming. After learning Python last semester,
         she decides to build an app to track her growing music collection. "How hard could it be?" she thinks,
         opening her laptop one Friday evening. All she needs is to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Store songs with ratings (1-5 stars)</li>
        <li>Update ratings when she changes her mind</li>
        <li>Find her favorite songs quickly</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Little does she know, her "quick weekend project" is about to teach her why
         planning data structure is crucial...</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="hard-coded-indices">
      <title>2. Hard-Coded Indices</title>
      <p> Audrey decides each song should be a list <c>[title, rating]</c>. Having worked with lists before,
        she feels confident and jumps straight into coding: </p>
      <listing xml:id="first-attempt">
        <title>Audrey's Hard-Coded Indices</title>
        <caption>Her first solution relies on knowing exactly where each piece of data lives in the list.</caption>
        <program language="python">
          music_library = [
          ["Imagine", 5], # index 0
          ["Thriller", 4], # index 1
          ["Hey Jude", 5] # index 2
          ]

          # Change "Thriller" rating from 4 to 3
          music_library[1][1] = 3
          print(music_library)
        </program>
      </listing>
      <p> When run, Python prints <c>[['Imagine', 5], ['Thriller', 3], ['Hey Jude', 5]]</c>. 
        This works for now, but only because Audrey remembers that:
        <ul>
          <li>"Thriller" is at position 1 in the outer list</li>
          <li>The rating is always at position 1 in each inner list</li>
        </ul>
        These assumptions make the code fragile - any change to the order or structure could break it.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="incremental-fixes">
      <title>3. Incremental "Fixes"</title>
      <p> Realizing that hard-coded indices like <c>music_library[1][1]</c> are risky, 
        Audrey tries to make her code more flexible with helper functions: </p>
      <listing xml:id="title-based-update">
        <title>Searching by Title Instead of Position</title>
        <caption>A more flexible approach that still has hidden assumptions about data layout.</caption>
        <program language="python">
          def find_song_index(library, song_title):
              for i in range(len(library)):
                  if library[i][0] == song_title: # Title is at index 0
                      return i

          def update_rating(library, song_title, new_rating):
              idx = find_song_index(library, song_title)
              library[idx][1] = new_rating  # Still assumes rating is at index 1

          music_library = [
              ["Imagine", 5],
              ["Thriller", 4],
              ["Hey Jude", 5]
          ]

          update_rating(music_library, "Thriller", 1)
          print(music_library)
        </program>
      </listing>
      <p> This is better - we're no longer dependent on knowing which row contains "Thriller". 
        But we're still assuming that:
        <ul>
          <li>The title is always at index 0</li>
          <li>The rating is always at index 1</li>
        </ul>
        These assumptions are buried in the code, making it hard to spot potential problems.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="adding-play-counts">
      <title>4. Adding Play Counts</title>
      <p> A week later, Audrey wants to track how often she listens to each song. She modifies each
        entry to include a play count: </p>
      <listing xml:id="adding-field">
        <title>Introducing a New Field</title>
        <caption>Adding play_count changes the data structure in ways that could break existing code.</caption>
        <program language="python">
          music_library = [
              ["Imagine", 5, 120],    # Now includes play count
              ["Thriller", 4, 230],
              ["Hey Jude", 5, 150]
          ]
        </program>
      </listing>
      <p> This seemingly simple change creates several problems:
        <ul>
          <li>The <c>update_rating</c> function still uses index 1 for ratings, which still works... for now</li>
          <li>If Audrey later reorders the fields to <c>[title, play_count, rating]</c>, the function will corrupt data</li>
          <li>New functions to update play counts might accidentally modify ratings if they guess wrong about indices</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><em>Key Lesson:</em> Without a clear definition of the data structure, even small changes can introduce
        subtle bugs that might not be immediately apparent.</p>

       3. Designing Data: Why It Matters
       ====================================== -->
  <section xml:id="why-data-design-matters">
    <title>Designing Data: Why It Matters</title>
    <p> <em>Programs</em> fundamentally do this: they take <em>input data</em>, transform or analyze it,
      and produce <em>output data</em>. Whether that data is a single integer or a complex structure
      with nested fields, the program’s success relies on everyone understanding <strong>exactly
      what the data is and how to interpret it</strong>. </p>
    <p> If you never plan or document this structure, you’re effectively “designing” as you
      code—mixing two hard tasks at once. This often leads to: <ul>
        <li><em>Ambiguous fields</em>: Is <c>song[2]</c> the rating or the play count? Could it become <c>genre</c>
        if we shift the order next week?</li>
        <li><em>Misinterpreted units</em>: Is <c>weight</c> in pounds or kilograms? Are <c>dates</c> in
      MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY format?</li>
        <li><em>Silent breakage</em>: Old code “thinks” a new field is something else, leading
          to bizarre outputs or corruption that can take hours to debug.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p> In earlier courses, you might have been <em>protected</em> from this problem because the
      instructor gave you a well-structured <c>Point</c> class, or a “student record” type, or a <c>database
      schema</c>. You simply followed it. But now, you’re the one deciding how to store data.
      Failing to define it clearly is a recipe for frustration. </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ======================================
     4. The First Step of a Design Recipe: Data Definition
     ====================================== -->
  <section xml:id="data-definition-step">
    <title>The First Step: Defining Your Data</title>
    <p> A <strong>data definition</strong> is a concise statement of: </p>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Which fields</em> or attributes exist (e.g., <c>title</c>, <c>rating</c>, <c>play_count</c>).</li>
      <li><em>How they’re typed or constrained</em> (e.g., rating is an integer 1–5, play_count is
        nonnegative, etc.).</li>
      <li><em>Any key assumptions</em> (like “rating can’t exceed 5,” or “dates must be in
        MM/DD/YYYY format”).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      For Audrey’s music library, we might define:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em> A <c>Song</c> is a Python list of the form <c>[title, rating, play_count]</c>, where: <ul>
            <li><c>title</c> is a string (e.g., <c>"Imagine"</c>).</li>
            <li><c>rating</c> is an integer in <c>[1..5]</c>.</li>
            <li><c>play_count</c> is a nonnegative integer (0 or greater).</li>
          </ul>
        </em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p> Why is this useful? Because if Audrey later decides “I need to store <c>artist</c>,” she’ll
      update the definition to: <c>[title, rating, play_count, artist]</c>. Every function that
      touches <c>Song</c> refers back to this “blueprint,” instead of guessing how many fields there
      are or which index is which. </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Assumptions &amp; Constraints:</strong> Notice we said <c>rating</c> can’t exceed 5. In
      Python, you might or might not write code to check that. But if you do—say, with an <c>if
      new_rating &amp; 5</c> check—then you can detect bad data early. In other languages, like Java,
      you could have a method that rejects any rating above 5 automatically. Either way, once you’ve
      written down “rating is 1–5,” it’s easier to test or enforce that assumption. </p>
    <p>
      <em>Micro-Exercise:</em> If you decide <c>play_count</c> can’t exceed 9999, how would you
      reflect that in your definition? Could you detect an invalid <c>play_count</c> in code and
      raise an error or log a warning? </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ======================================
       5. Designing vs. Implementing
       ====================================== -->
  <section xml:id="design-vs-implementation">
    <title>Separating Design from Implementation</title>
    <p> One reason novices skip data definitions is they jump right into “let’s make a loop in
      Python” or “let’s code a quick function to do X.” But when you do that, you’re <strong>
      implicitly</strong> designing the data <strong>while</strong> you implement logic—a mental juggling act that can
      be error-prone. </p>
    <p> <em>Best Practice:</em> Pause before coding. Ask: <em>"What data do I have? Where do these fields
      come from? Do they have constraints?
        How might they evolve over time?”</em> By addressing these questions early, you create a
      stable foundation that makes the actual coding smoother and less likely to break with new
      requirements. </p>
    <p> This is the <em>first step</em> of a broader <strong>design recipe</strong> you’ll practice
      throughout this course. You’ll see that once data is well-defined, you can systematically
      define each function’s <strong>contract</strong> (what it takes in, what it returns), write tests, and
      iterate your design. </p>

  <section xml:id="typed-languages">
    <title>Looking Ahead: Java's Type System</title>
    
    <p>Let's peek at how Java can help enforce data definitions automatically. Don't worry if the
       Java code looks unfamiliar—you're not expected to understand it fully yet. The goal is to see
       how a typed language can catch data-related mistakes early.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="java-song-class">
      <title>A Song in Java</title>
      <listing xml:id="song-java">
        <program language="java">

              // 'private' means these variables can only be changed
              // using the methods we provide below
              private String title;        // The song's name
              private int rating;          // Must be 1-5
              private int playCount;       // Must be >= 0

              public void setPlayCount(int newCount) {
                  if (newCount &lt; 0) {
                      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Play count can't be negative");
                  }
                  playCount = newCount;
              }

              public void setTitle(String newTitle) {`
                  if (newTitle == null || newTitle.isEmpty()) {
                      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Title cannot be empty");
                  }

              }
          }
        </program>
      </listing>
      <p>This Java code <em>enforces</em> our data definition in several ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The variables are <c>private</c>, meaning they can only be changed using our special methods.</li>
        <li>Each "setter" method checks that the new value is valid before making any changes.</li>
        <li>The compiler ensures we can't accidentally put a number where text should go (or vice versa).</li>
      </ul>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="compiler-catches-errors">
      <title>The Compiler as Your Assistant</title>
      <listing xml:id="java-errors">
        <program language="java">
          Song song = new Song();
          
          // These won't compile - Java catches type mismatches
          song.setRating("five");         // Error: rating must be a number!
          song.setPlayCount("lots");      // Error: play count must be a number!
          
          // These compile but fail when run - our methods catch invalid values
          song.setRating(10);             // Error: rating must be 1-5
          song.setPlayCount(-5);          // Error: can't have negative plays
          song.setTitle("");              // Error: title can't be empty
        </program>
      </listing>
      <p>Again, don't stress if this Java syntax feels overwhelming—you'll learn it step by step.
         The key idea is that Java's type system acts like a helpful assistant, catching many data-related
         mistakes before your program even runs.</p>

      <title>Focus on the Concepts First</title>
      <p>For now, focus on understanding why data definitions matter. The Java examples above are just
         a preview of how programming languages can help enforce good data design. Feel free to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask your instructor to explain any Java code that interests you</li>
        <li>Use AI tools like ChatGPT to explore Java concepts</li>
        <li>Discuss the code with classmates—explaining things to others often helps both parties learn</li>

     7. Reflection and Next Steps
     ====================================== -->
  <section xml:id="reflection-next-steps">
    <title>Reflection and Next Steps</title>
    <p> Audrey’s incremental “fixes” all failed the moment she changed the order of fields or added
      a new one. By contrast, a data definition—like <c>[title, rating, play_count]</c>— serves as a
      stable reference point: any code that modifies or reads a field can check the blueprint to
      avoid silent breakage. </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Takeaways:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><em>All programs revolve around data:</em> if you don’t define it up front, you risk
          layering assumptions until they collapse under new features.</li>
        <li><em>Constraints become testable:</em> once you say “rating is ≤ 5,” you can
          systematically check that in Python, or in a typed language like Java, you might disallow
          setting rating above 5 altogether. Both approaches reduce guesswork.</li>
        <li><em>A design recipe starts with data:</em> it might feel “extra,” but separating data
          layout from coding logic frees you to adapt your program without everything breaking
          unexpectedly.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p> In the next chapter, we’ll see <em>how</em> to define each function’s “Contract” once we have a
      clear data definition. Just as data needs a specification, so do functions: we’ll specify what
      inputs they take, what outputs they give, and any invariants (like not accepting a <c>play_count</c>
      less than 0). By combining these steps— data definition, then function
      contracts, then testing—we build a robust, iterative path to maintainable code. </p>
