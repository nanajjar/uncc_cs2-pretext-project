  <title>Classes and Objects</title>

  <p>
    So far, we've battled this messy situation:
  </p>

  <listing xml:id="messy-situation">
    <caption>Messy Separate Variables</caption>
    <program language="java"><![CDATA[
// Player 1's stats
int player1Health = 100;
int player1Gold = 50;

// Player 2's stats (getting messy...)
int player2Health = 100;
int player2Gold = 50;

// Whoops, which health am I changing?
player1Health = healPlayer(player2Health, 5); // Easy mistake!
]]></program>
  </listing>

  <p> Methods helped a bit, but we still pass variables around separately. <strong>Wouldn't it be
    great</strong> if all these stats lived in <em>one</em> place? </p>

  <subsection xml:id="a-single-entity-that-owns-its-data">
    <title>A Single “Entity” That Owns Its Data</title>

    <p> Let’s pretend we want to treat the player as a single <em>entity</em>, storing <em>all</em>
      of that player’s stats in one “box.” We also want that “box” to have special “buttons” (like
      “heal” or “add gold”) that automatically change <em>that</em> player’s stats. </p>
    <p> That’s exactly what Java’s <strong>class</strong> feature will let us do. But let’s build it
      slowly so it’s not mysterious. </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="step-1-empty-container-player">
    <title>Step 1: An Empty "Container" Called <c>Player</c></title>

    <p>
      Let's start with the most basic version of this feature. Here's the smallest possible
      container we can make:
    </p>

    <listing xml:id="empty-player-class">
      <caption>An Empty Player Class</caption>
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
public class Player {
    // We'll fill details in soon!
}
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><c>public class Player</c> — This line starts defining our container.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <c>{ }</c> braces mark what belongs inside it.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p> This might look empty and useless, but we've just done something powerful: we've created a
      new <em>type</em> in Java. Just like <c>int</c> lets us create numbers and <c>String</c> lets
      us create text, <c>Player</c> will let us create... well, players! We'll fill in what that
      means exactly, but the key idea is there: Java lets us create our <em>own</em> types to
      represent anything we need in our programs. </p>
    <p>
      Right now our container is empty—like an empty box. It compiles, but doesn't hold anything
      yet. Let's fix that next.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="step-2-variables-inside-box">
    <title>Step 2: Putting Variables Inside That Box</title>

    <p>
      Remember how we used to write:
    </p>

    <listing xml:id="separate-vars">
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
int playerHealth;
int playerGold;
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p> in our <c>main</c> method? Instead of having these floating around separately, we can put
      them <em>inside</em> our container: </p>

    <listing xml:id="player-with-fields">
      <caption>Adding Fields to the Player</caption>
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
public class Player {
    // These belong to the Player now
    int health;
    int gold;
}
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p> This is like saying "every Player has their own health and gold." When we create a Player
      (using <c>new Player()</c>), Java sets aside space for both variables. They'll start at 0 by
      default, which isn't great—we usually want to pick starting values like <c>(10, 50)</c>. We'll
      fix that next, but first appreciate what we've done: we've moved from separate, floating
      variables to a single container that keeps related data together. </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="step-3-setting-initial-values">
    <title>Step 3: Setting Initial Values</title>

    <p>
      Remember how our variables defaulted to 0? That's not great for a game—we want to choose
      starting values. If this was a method, we'd write something like:
    </p>

    <listing xml:id="createplayer-method-style">
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
public static Player createPlayer(int startHealth, int startGold) {
    // ... somehow make a Player with these values ...
}
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p>
      Since creating objects with initial values is something we do constantly, Java gives us
      special syntax for it—a shorter, cleaner way to write this common task:
    </p>

    <listing xml:id="constructor-example">
      <caption>Adding a Constructor</caption>
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
public class Player {
    int health;
    int gold;

    // Like createPlayer, but special syntax!
    // Constructor syntax:
    // 1. Same name as the class
    // 2. No return type (not even void)
    // 3. public ClassName(parameters) { ... }
    public Player(int startHealth, int startGold) {
        health = startHealth;  // set this Player's health
        gold   = startGold;    // set this Player's gold
    }
}
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p> Now instead of calling <c>createPlayer(10, 50)</c>, we write: </p>

    <listing xml:id="using-constructor">
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
Player p = new Player(10, 50);
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p> What happens when you write <c>new Player(10, 50)</c>? </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><c>new</c> tells Java to create space in memory</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Java fills that space with default values (0 for numbers)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The constructor runs to set up the object properly</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You get back a reference to your new <c>Player</c></p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p> This special method is called a <strong>constructor</strong>. You might wonder: "Doesn't it
      return a Player?" It does, but Java's grammar treats constructors specially—they implicitly
      return the new object without needing a return type. That's why: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The name matches the class (<c>Player</c>)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There's no return type (Java handles that for us)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You'll see this pattern everywhere in Java:
    </p>
    <listing xml:id="common-constructors">
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
String name = new String("Alice");      // Make new String with "Alice"
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // Make new Scanner reading System.in
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p>
      The constructor tells Java "when someone asks for a new Player, here's how to set it up."
      Much better than default 0s!
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="step-4-adding-operations">
    <title>Step 4: Adding "Operations" for That Player</title>

    <p> Remember how we wrote methods before? Each had a return type (like <c>int</c> or <c>void</c>)
      and parameters in parentheses. We'll do the same here, but inside our class: </p>
    <p>
      Why not just use static methods? Let's compare approaches:
    </p>

    <listing xml:id="static-vs-instance">
      <caption>Static vs. Instance Method</caption>
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Static approach - explicitly pass everything
////////////////////////////////////////////////
public static void healPlayer(int currentHealth, int healAmount) {
    currentHealth += healAmount;
}

////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Instance method approach - data is inside
////////////////////////////////////////////////
public void heal(int amount) {
    this.health += amount;  // 'this' refers to current Player
}
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p>
      The instance method might look simpler, but what's really happening? When you write:
    </p>

    <listing xml:id="instance-call">
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
player1.heal(5);
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p> Java secretly translates this to something like “<em>call heal with the data belonging to
      player1</em>.” That's what <c>this</c> means in an instance method—it's a reference to "the
      object we're calling this method on." So: </p>

    <listing xml:id="this-keyword-use">
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
public void heal(int amount) {
    this.health += amount;  // explicitly say "this object's health"
}
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p>
      is the same as:
    </p>

    <listing xml:id="this-keyword-implicit">
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
public void heal(int amount) {
    health += amount; // 'this.' is implicit
}
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p>
      The instance method approach is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>More intuitive ("tell the player to heal")</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Safer (data bundle stays together)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Less typing (no need to pass every field)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Much better than juggling separate variables and explicit parameters!</p>

    <subsubsection xml:id="the-this-keyword">
      <title>The 'this' Keyword: Who Am I?</title>
      <p> When writing instance methods, you might wonder: "How does Java know which Player's health
        to change?" The answer is the <c>this</c> keyword. </p>
      <listing xml:id="this-keyword-confusion">
        <caption>Example of `this` Usage</caption>
        <program language="java"><![CDATA[
public class Player {
    int health;
    // ...other fields...

    public void heal(int health) {  // Uh oh, parameter named same as field!
        health = health;    // Which health is which? 😕
    }

    // Better: use 'this' to be clear
    public void heal(int health) {
        this.health = health;  // "THIS object's health = parameter health"
    }
}
]]></program>
      </listing>
      <p> When you call <c>player1.heal(5)</c>, Java secretly passes <c>player1</c> to the method as <c>
        this</c>. You can think of it like: </p>
      <listing xml:id="this-keyword-internal">
        <program language="java"><![CDATA[
// What you write:
player1.heal(5);

// What Java effectively does:
heal(player1, 5); // player1 becomes 'this' inside the method
]]></program>
      </listing>
      <p> The <c>this</c> keyword is especially useful when: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Parameter names match field names</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You need to pass the current object to another method</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You want to be extra clear about which variable you're using</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Usually you can skip writing <c>this.</c> (it's implicit), but it's there if you need it!</p>

      Look how natural this is:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><c>new Player(10, 50)</c> creates a fresh Player with starting values</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><c>p1.heal(5)</c> tells <em>that specific Player</em> to heal itself</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each Player keeps track of its own stats</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Now that we've seen it in action, let's give these ideas their proper names:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A Player we create (like <c>p1</c> or <c>p2</c>) is called an <strong>object</strong> or <strong>
          instance</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The methods inside Player (like <c>heal</c>) are called <strong>instance methods</strong>
          because they work on a specific instance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The setup code (like <c>Player(10, 50)</c>) is called a <strong>constructor</strong>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Think of it like this: You wrote a recipe (<c>Player</c> class), and now you can bake as
      many cookies (<c>Player</c> objects) as you want. Each cookie has its own ingredients (<c>
      health</c>, <c>gold</c>), but they all follow the same recipe! </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="one-blueprint-many-objects">
    <title>One Blueprint, Many Objects</title>

    <p>
      Think about how games like Minecraft work:
    </p>

    <listing xml:id="one-blueprint">
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
// Define the blueprint once
public class Player {
    int health;
    int gold;
    // ...constructor and methods as before...
}

// Create many different players from it
Player steve = new Player(20, 0);    // Steve starts with 20 health, 0 gold
Player alex  = new Player(20, 100);  // Alex starts with 20 health, 100 gold
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p> When <c>steve.heal(5)</c> runs, it only changes Steve's health. Alex's stats stay the same.
      Each object is independent, just like: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>One house blueprint → many different houses</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>One recipe → many different cookies</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>One character class in a game → many different players</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p> When we say <c>Player p1 = new Player(...)</c>, we say <c>p1</c> is an “instance” of that
      class. That’s just fancy talk for “a house built from the blueprint.” No big mystery! </p>
    <p>
      The class is just the instructions (“Players have health and gold”). The objects are the
      actual things we create using those instructions. That's why we say “class is the blueprint,
      objects are the houses.”
