  <title>Method Parameters</title>

  <p> Remember how methods helped us avoid copying and pasting code? That was great! But as our
    programs grow bigger, we're running into a new problem: <em>too many separate variables</em>
    that really belong together. </p>

       The Problem: Too Many Separate Pieces

    <title>The Problem: Too Many Separate Pieces</title>

    <p>
      Think of it like packing for school. Instead of one backpack, imagine carrying:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Your math textbook in one hand</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your pencil case in another</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your calculator in your pocket</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your notebook under your arm</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your lunch box... somehow?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Sure, you <em>could</em> do it, but it's awkward and things might fall! This is exactly
      what's happening in our game code: </p>

    <listing xml:id="separate-variables-example">
      <caption>Many Separate Variables</caption>
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
int playerHealth  = 100;
int playerGold    = 50;
int playerXp      = 0;
int playerMana    = 75;
int playerStamina = 90;
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p> All these variables describe one thing (<em>the player</em>), but we're carrying them
      separately. This leads to clumsy method calls: </p>

    <listing xml:id="too-many-params">
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
// We have to pass everything one by one
public static int increaseHealth(int currentHealth, int healAmount) {
    return currentHealth + healAmount;
}

public static int increaseGold(int currentGold, int goldReward) {
    return currentGold + goldReward;
}

// Using them gets tedious
playerHealth = increaseHealth(playerHealth, 5);
playerGold   = increaseGold(playerGold, 10);
]]></program>

    <title>Why This Is A Problem</title>

    <p>Here‚Äôs why juggling so many separate variables causes trouble:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Too Many Parameters</strong>: What if we need a method that changes both health <em>
          and</em> gold? We'd need something like:</p>
        <listing xml:id="award-victory-future">
          <program language="java"><![CDATA[
public static void awardVictory(int health, int gold, int xp, int mana /* ... */) {
    // ...
}
]]></program>
        </listing>
        <p>
          That's a lot to keep track of!
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Easy Mistakes</strong>: The compiler can't help us if we mix up the order:</p>
        <listing xml:id="swapped-params">
          <program language="java"><![CDATA[
// Oops! Accidentally swapped health and gold
awardVictory(playerGold, playerHealth);  // This will compile! üò±
]]></program>
        </listing>
        <p>It compiles, but it's obviously wrong‚ÄîJava doesn't know they're reversed.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Multiple Players</strong>: It gets worse with two players:</p>
        <listing xml:id="two-players">
          <program language="java"><![CDATA[
int player1Health = 100;
int player1Gold   = 50;

int player2Health = 100;
int player2Gold   = 50;

// ... this is getting out of hand!
]]></program>
        </listing>
      </li>
    </ol>

  <subsection xml:id="the-solution-grouping-related-things">
    <title>The Solution: Grouping Related Things Together</title>

    <p> Just like how a backpack keeps all your school supplies together, Java has a way to keep
      related variables together: it‚Äôs called a <em>class</em>. </p>
    <p> Instead of juggling separate variables, we can create a <c>Player</c> class that keeps track
      of its own stats: </p>

    <listing xml:id="player-class-preview">
      <caption>A Preview of a Player Class</caption>
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
// This is a preview - we'll learn how to write this soon!
Player p1 = new Player(100, 50, 0, 75, 90);
p1.increaseHealth(5); // So much simpler!
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p>
      Think of a class like a blueprint for creating objects that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Keep their related data together (like health, gold, etc.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Include methods that work with that data</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Protect their data from accidental misuse</p>

    <exercise xml:id="mc-too-many-pieces">
      <title>Multiple Choice: Why Too Many Separate Pieces Is a Problem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In the "Method Parameters" section, we compared carrying many separate school items
          to storing many separate player stats. Which statement below best captures why this
          approach can cause issues?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <choices randomize="yes">
        <choice>
          <statement> Because Java forbids having more than three <c>int</c> variables in a class. </statement>
          <feedback> Java doesn't have a hard limit on the number of <c>int</c> variables; the issue
            is about code organization. </feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="yes">
          <statement>
            It becomes easy to mix up or misuse parameters, and methods end up with too many
            arguments to manage safely.
          </statement>
          <feedback>
            Correct. Too many separate variables means large parameter lists and accidental ordering
            mistakes.
          </feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice>
          <statement>
            We can‚Äôt compile if we have more than two parameters in a method header.
          </statement>
          <feedback>
            Not true; Java methods can have many parameters, but it‚Äôs still risky or unwieldy to do
            so.
          </feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice>
          <statement> Passing multiple <c>int</c> variables will permanently corrupt memory in Java. </statement>
          <feedback>
            Java won't corrupt memory. The real danger is logical mistakes with too many separate
            pieces.
          </feedback>
        </choice>

    <!-- 2) TRUE/FALSE: SWAPPED PARAMETERS -->
    <exercise xml:id="tf-swapped-parameters" type="truefalse">
      <title>True/False: Swapped Parameters</title>
      <statement correct="yes"> If two method parameters have the same type, swapping them by
        accident (e.g., passing <c>playerGold</c> where <c>playerHealth</c> is expected) will still
        compile and could lead to unexpected behavior at runtime. </statement>
      <feedback>
        The compiler won't stop you if the swapped parameters are both the same type,
        making it a silent but dangerous error.

    <exercise xml:id="sa-multiple-players">
      <title>Short Answer: Handling Multiple Players</title>
      <statement>
        <p> In the section, we saw how having <c>player1Health, player2Health, player1Gold, player2Gold</c>, and so on can get ‚Äúout of hand.‚Äù In <em>1‚Äì2 sentences</em>, explain why

      <response />
      <solution>
        <p>
          <strong>Sample Solution:</strong> Each player has several stats to track, so using a
          separate variable for each stat (like <c>player1Health</c>, <c>player2Health</c>, etc.)
          quickly leads to long parameter lists and confusion. Bundling them into a single structure
          (a ‚Äúbackpack‚Äù or a <c>Player</c> class) simplifies both method calls and data
          organization. </p>

        <p> Consider the method signature <c>public static void transferMoney(int fromBalance, int toBalance, int amount)</c>. Which of the following <em>best</em> describes the biggest
          risk with this approach? </p>
      </statement>
      <choices randomize="yes">
        <choice correct="yes">
          <statement> Mixing up <c>fromBalance</c> and <c>toBalance</c> is easy to do, and the
            compiler won‚Äôt catch it. </statement>
          <feedback> Precisely. Since all parameters are <c>int</c>, swapping them won't trigger a

        <choice>
          <statement>
            The code will always trigger a compile-time error if someone calls the function with the
            wrong order.

        <choice>
          <statement> It‚Äôs impossible to pass three parameters to a <c>void</c> method in Java. </statement>

            Not true. Java allows as many parameters as you want.

    <!-- 5) REFLECTION/DISCUSSION: CLASS PREVIEW -->
    <exercise xml:id="reflection-class-preview">
      <title>Reflection: Preview of Classes</title>

        <p> We saw a hint of a <c>Player</c> class that might hold <c>health</c>, <c>gold</c>, <c>xp</c>,
          etc. In <em>2‚Äì3 sentences</em>, describe why bundling these stats into a single object
          could make code easier to maintain, <strong>before</strong> we even learn the full syntax
          of classes. </p>
      </statement>
      <response />
      <solution>
        <p>
          <strong>Sample Solution:</strong> One object can store all the player‚Äôs related data, so
          we don‚Äôt have to pass a dozen parameters whenever we modify or read stats. It also reduces
          the risk of mixing up parameter order. Once we have an object, we can define methods like <c>p1.increaseHealth(5)</c> that automatically update the right fields, making the code more
