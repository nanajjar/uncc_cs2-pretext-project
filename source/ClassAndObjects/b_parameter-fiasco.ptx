  <title>Method Parameters</title>

  <p> Remember how methods helped us avoid copying and pasting code? That was great! But as our
    programs grow bigger, we're running into a new problem: <em>too many separate variables</em>
    that really belong together. </p>

       The Problem: Too Many Separate Pieces

    <title>The Problem: Too Many Separate Pieces</title>

    <p>
      Think of it like packing for school. Instead of one backpack, imagine carrying:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Your math textbook in one hand</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your pencil case in another</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your calculator in your pocket</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your notebook under your arm</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your lunch box... somehow?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Sure, you <em>could</em> do it, but it's awkward and things might fall! This is exactly
      what's happening in our game code: </p>

    <listing xml:id="separate-variables-example">
      <caption>Many Separate Variables</caption>
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
int playerHealth  = 100;
int playerGold    = 50;
int playerXp      = 0;
int playerMana    = 75;
int playerStamina = 90;
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p> All these variables describe one thing (<em>the player</em>), but we're carrying them
      separately. This leads to clumsy method calls: </p>

    <listing xml:id="too-many-params">
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
// We have to pass everything one by one
public static int increaseHealth(int currentHealth, int healAmount) {
    return currentHealth + healAmount;
}

public static int increaseGold(int currentGold, int goldReward) {
    return currentGold + goldReward;
}

// Using them gets tedious
playerHealth = increaseHealth(playerHealth, 5);
playerGold   = increaseGold(playerGold, 10);
]]></program>

    <title>Why This Is A Problem</title>

    <p>Hereâ€™s why juggling so many separate variables causes trouble:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Too Many Parameters</strong>: What if we need a method that changes both health <em>
          and</em> gold? We'd need something like:</p>
        <listing xml:id="award-victory-future">
          <program language="java"><![CDATA[
public static void awardVictory(int health, int gold, int xp, int mana /* ... */) {
    // ...
}
]]></program>
        </listing>
        <p>
          That's a lot to keep track of!
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Easy Mistakes</strong>: The compiler can't help us if we mix up the order:</p>
        <listing xml:id="swapped-params">
          <program language="java"><![CDATA[
// Oops! Accidentally swapped health and gold
awardVictory(playerGold, playerHealth);  // This will compile! ðŸ˜±
]]></program>
        </listing>
        <p>It compiles, but it's obviously wrongâ€”Java doesn't know they're reversed.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Multiple Players</strong>: It gets worse with two players:</p>
        <listing xml:id="two-players">
          <program language="java"><![CDATA[
int player1Health = 100;
int player1Gold   = 50;

int player2Health = 100;
int player2Gold   = 50;

// ... this is getting out of hand!
]]></program>
        </listing>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <title>The Solution: Grouping Related Things Together</title>

    <p> Just like how a backpack keeps all your school supplies together, Java has a way to keep
      related variables together: itâ€™s called a <em>class</em>. </p>
    <p> Instead of juggling separate variables, we can create a <c>Player</c> class that keeps track
      of its own stats: </p>

    <listing xml:id="player-class-preview">
      <caption>A Preview of a Player Class</caption>
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
// This is a preview - we'll learn how to write this soon!
Player p1 = new Player(100, 50, 0, 75, 90);
p1.increaseHealth(5); // So much simpler!
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p>
      Think of a class like a blueprint for creating objects that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Keep their related data together (like health, gold, etc.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Include methods that work with that data</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Protect their data from accidental misuse</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <strong>1. Group Related Things</strong><br /> If you were making a <c>BankAccount</c>, what
      information would belong together? Think: <em>balance, account number, interest rate...</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2. Spot the Problem</strong><br /> How many things could go wrong with: </p>
    <listing xml:id="transfer-money">
      <program language="java"><![CDATA[
public static void transferMoney(int fromBalance, int toBalance, int amount)
]]></program>
    </listing>

    <p> What if someone mixes up the order of <c>fromBalance</c> and <c>toBalance</c>? </p>

    <p>
      <em>Next up:</em> We'll see how to solve these problems by learning about classes â€“ a way to
      keep related data and methods together, just like a backpack keeps your school supplies
      organized! </p>
