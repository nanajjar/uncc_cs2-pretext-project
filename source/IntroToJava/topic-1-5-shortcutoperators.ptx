  <title>Compound Assignment Operators</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>Compound assignment operators are shortcuts that do a math operation and assignment in one step. For example, <c>x += 1</c> adds 1 to x and assigns the sum to x. It is the same as <c>x = x + 1</c>. This pattern is possible with any operator put in front of the = sign, as seen below.</p>

    <p>The most common shortcut operator <c>++</c>, the plus-plus or <term>increment</term> operator, is used to add 1 to the current value; <c>x++</c> is the same as <c>x += 1</c> and the same as <c>x = x + 1</c>. It is a shortcut that is used a lot in loops. If you’ve heard of the programming language C++, the ++ in C++ is an inside joke that C has been incremented or improved to create C++. The <c>--</c> decrement operator is used to subtract 1 from the current value: <c>y--</c> is the same as <c>y = y - 1</c>. These are the only two double operators; this shortcut pattern does not exist with other operators. Run the following code to see these shortcut operators in action!</p>
    <note>
            <p>On the exam you can use <c>x++</c> or <c>++x</c> to add one to the value of <c>x</c>.  These two shortcuts only have different results if you assign the value of <c>x</c> to another variable as in <c>int y = ++x;</c> (where the value of x is incremented before y is set to it) or <c>int y = x++;</c> (where y is set to a copy of x’s value before x is incremented).  The AP exam will never use a shortcut in an assignment statement, so you don’t need to worry about the difference between <c>++x</c> or <c>x++</c>.</p>
