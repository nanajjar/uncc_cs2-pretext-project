      <block order="1">
        <cline>employees = [['Alice', 'Sales'], ['Michael', 'Sales'], ['Sarah', 'Marketing'], ['John', 'Marketing']]
        </cline>  
      <cline>for person in employees:</cline>
      <cline>    if person[1] == 'Sales':</cline>
      <cline>        print(person[0], 'is an employee in Sales')</cline>
