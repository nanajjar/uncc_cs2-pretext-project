## Week 2

```text
Your audience today are CS2 students listening from home on MLK Day as if you’re lecturing. They’ve learned basic Python (variables, control flow, lists) and will soon learn Java. Please discuss each Design Recipe step, showing how structured design cures blank-project blues. Emphasize why each step matters, solves typical pains, and tout the big payoff. lab-2 and lab-3 are the lab assignments this week which they must prepare for by reading the design recipe chapters before lab. Have fun!
