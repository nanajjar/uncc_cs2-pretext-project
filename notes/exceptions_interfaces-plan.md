Below is an **enhanced four-section plan**—it hews to your layout (Exceptions first, then Interfaces), integrates the TA's "compiler enforcement" narrative, and incorporates the "story-like flow" you've used in your chapters so far. The main shift is to strengthen the **narrative problem** in Section 1—starting from the sentinel-return "pain" and moving naturally into exceptions—while keeping your structure of:

1. **Throwing Exceptions & Try/Catch**  
2. **Standard Library Exceptions (java.lang, etc.)**  
3. **Introducing Interfaces**  
4. **Common Library Interfaces (Comparable, Iterable, etc.)**  

You can view these as four `.ptx` files under a single "Exceptions & Interfaces" chapter, or you can merge them into fewer sections if you prefer. Either way, here's a detailed plan for each part.

---

## **Section 1: From Sentinel Values to Throwing Exceptions**

### **Narrative Hook**

1. **The Recurring Sentinel Problem**  
   - Start with a short snippet reminiscent of the old `MyIterator` returning `-999` (or `null`) to signal "no more elements."  
   - Show how easily the caller could *forget* to check that sentinel, leading to hidden bugs.  
   - Make it story-like: *"One day, you realize your code never noticed -999!"* or *"Users typed in a negative balance, and we quietly stored it as a sentinel."*

2. **Why This Fails**  
   - Summarize the downsides: The compiler can't force the caller to handle `-999`, so ignoring it is trivial. The program "keeps going" incorrectly.

### **Introducing `throw`**

1. **Minimal Example**  
   - Show a method that *would* return a sentinel but now does:  

     ```java
     if (!hasNext()) {
         throw new NoSuchElementException("No more data!");
     }
     ```

   - Emphasize the immediate difference: ignoring the error is no longer an option—the runtime forcibly halts if unhandled.

2. **How the Compiler & Runtime Step In**  
   - Distinguish that some exceptions are "unchecked" (like `NoSuchElementException`) so the compiler won't *force* a try/catch.  
   - But it still means the caller *cannot proceed* silently if the exception is thrown.  
   - This is the major advantage over sentinel values: the language *enforces* a reaction.

### **Basic Try/Catch**  

1. **Gentle Intro**  
   - Show a short snippet with a `try` block that might throw an exception, then a `catch` that logs or re-throws.  
   - This reveals how the runtime unwinds the stack until it finds a matching `catch`.

2. **Compiler Enforcement (Sneak Peek)**  
   - Mention that for some exceptions (checked ones) the compiler *forces* you to either handle them or declare them with `throws`.  
   - Promise details in the next section.

### **Pitfalls & Exercises**  

- **Pitfalls**:
  - *"Don't throw a cryptic exception or swallow it."*  
  - *"Avoid launching exceptions for normal flow; use them for truly invalid states."*
- **Exercises**:
  - *Rewrite a sentinel-based method to throw a standard `NoSuchElementException` or `IllegalStateException`.*  
  - *Explain how ignoring a sentinel can slip by the compiler, but ignoring a thrown exception can't.*

---

## **Section 2: Standard Library Exceptions & Compiler Enforcement**

### **Overview & "java.lang"**  

1. **Where Exceptions Live**  
   - Show that many standard exceptions (e.g., `NullPointerException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`) are in `java.lang`, which is auto-imported. Others (like `IOException`) are in `java.io`.
   - Emphasize that these are official classes that come with Java, each describing a common error scenario.

### **Checked vs. Unchecked**  

1. **Definition & Behavior**  
   - *Checked* exceptions must be declared or handled, or the code won't compile. E.g., `IOException`.  
   - *Unchecked* exceptions (subclass of `RuntimeException`) do not require explicit handling. E.g., `NullPointerException`.  
2. **Compiler Rigor**  
   - A snippet showing a method that can throw `IOException` requires a `throws IOException` or a `try/catch`.
   - The compiler error if you fail to do so: *"Unreported exception: must be caught or declared to be thrown."*

### **Common Standard Exceptions**  

1. **Tour of Typical Cases**  
   - `IllegalArgumentException` or `IllegalStateException` for invalid arguments/states.  
   - `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if an index is outside array/`ArrayList` bounds.  
   - `NullPointerException`, `NumberFormatException`, etc.  
   - Explain each quickly in a bullet list, with short code examples.

### **Try/Catch & `throws` in Depth**  

1. **Expanding the Basics**  
   - Show a method that reads from a file: you must either do a `try/catch` or `throws IOException`.
   - Stress that *the compiler is protecting us from "silent ignoring" of major I/O errors.*

2. **Best Practices**  
   - *Don't catch everything and do nothing.*  
   - *Use standard exceptions before rolling your own.*  
   - *Don't rely on exceptions for normal branching logic.*  

### **Pitfalls & Exercises**  

- **Pitfalls**:  
  - Catching `Exception` generically can hamper clarity.  
  - Overusing unchecked exceptions might hide potential problems from the caller.  
- **Exercises**:  
  - "Which exceptions are checked?"  
  - "Write a file-reading method that throws/handles `IOException` properly."

---

## **Section 3: Introducing Interfaces (Contracts, Not Recipes)**

### **1. Narrative Setup & Motivation**

1. **Story Hook**  
   - Begin with a short anecdote (akin to the earlier "sentinel fiasco" or "exception discovery" stories) featuring inconsistent method names or missing methods.  
   - For example: *"You followed the Design Recipe carefully: everything's documented. Then a user reports that half your scheduling classes don't actually 'schedule' anything because you accidentally named the method `addTask`. Java never warned you—no compile error! So your design recipe was correct, but the compiler couldn't enforce it."*

2. **Link to Past Sections**  
   - Acknowledge that, with exceptions, Java forced us to handle errors. *"Now we'll see how Java enforces consistency of our method contracts—just as exceptions enforce handling of problems."*

3. **Learning Goal**  
   - Clearly state: *"By the end of this section, you'll see how interfaces automate part of our Design Recipe, ensuring we cannot silently deviate from the method signatures we design."*

> **Constructivist Note**: This initial story primes students to identify the **problem** themselves—lack of compile-time checks for method consistency. They start craving a solution before you formally introduce interfaces.

---

### **2. Introducing the Concept of Interfaces**

1. **Definition & Motivation**  
   - *"An interface is a Java construct that defines a set of methods—just the signatures. When a class says `implements YourInterface`, Java checks at compile time that those methods exist exactly as declared."*

2. **Tie to the Design Recipe**  
   - Emphasize how **Step 2** (Method Signature & Purpose Statement) effectively becomes **compiler-enforced** if you put those signatures in an interface:

     ```java
     /**
      * Example: The Scheduler interface from our Design Recipe Step 2
      */
     public interface Scheduler {
         void schedule(Task t); 
     }
     ```

   - *"This is how you transform your documented method signature into a guarantee the compiler will uphold."*

3. **Minimal Code Example**  
   - Show a short snippet of an interface `Scheduler` and a class `DailyScheduler` implementing it.  
   - Then demonstrate the compiler error if you forget or rename the method.  
   - *"This is the compiler doing what we wanted all along—catching method mismatches early."*

> **Cognitive Load Note**: Keep this first exposure to interfaces simple—one interface, one method. Avoid introducing multiple interfaces or advanced concepts like default methods. This reduces extraneous load.

---

### **3. Interfaces as Types (Polymorphism & Reusability)**

1. **Explain How Interfaces Become "Generalized" Types**  
   - Show how you can write:

     ```java
     public void processScheduler(Scheduler s) {
         s.schedule(new Task("Test"));
     }
     ```

   - *"Any class implementing `Scheduler` can be passed here without changing `processScheduler`. This fosters reusable, flexible code."*

2. **Emphasize Type Safety**  
   - *"The compiler ensures `s` has a `schedule(Task)` method. No runtime 'method not found' errors. This is how Java enforces your design recipe's defined behavior—no silent deviations."*

3. **Practical Example**  
   - Suppose you have multiple classes: `DailyScheduler`, `WeeklyScheduler`, `PriorityScheduler`. Show how the method happily accepts them:

     ```java
     processScheduler(new DailyScheduler());
     processScheduler(new WeeklyScheduler());
     processScheduler(new PriorityScheduler());
     ```

   - *"No code duplication needed. The interface unifies them by the contract we specified in the Design Recipe."*

> **Constructivist Note**: Let students experiment with different classes. Have them rename methods and see the compiler errors or success. This "discovery" cements the concept of how interfaces unify otherwise different classes.

---

### **4. Reinforcing the Design Recipe Connection**

1. **Step-by-Step Recap**  
   - Show how each step of the recipe (especially Steps 0–2) maps neatly onto what an interface does:
     - **Step 0 (Restate Problem)**: "We need scheduling across multiple classes..."  
     - **Step 1 (Data Definitions)**: "We have a `Task` class, no `null` tasks, etc."  
     - **Step 2 (Method Signature)**: "We documented `void schedule(Task t)`."  
     - **Interface**: "We encode that signature directly in `Scheduler`."

2. **Examples & Tests**  
   - Revisit Step 3 (Examples & Tests): *"We can write tests ensuring each class implementing `Scheduler` actually does something meaningful in `schedule(...)`. Our test code references the interface, verifying consistent usage across many implementing classes."*

3. **Advantages**  
   - Summarize:
     - **Compiler Enforcement**: *"Forces us not to skip or rename the method."*  
     - **Reduced Coupling**: *"Classes only rely on the interface, not each other's internals."*  
     - **Clean Integration with Exceptions**: *"If your method `schedule` is supposed to throw a checked exception under certain conditions, that's also reflected in the interface signature with `throws ...`."*

---

### **5. Constructivist Classroom Activities & Cognitive Load Management**

1. **Activity A: Discovering the Need for Interfaces**  
   - **Goal**: Let students build two "schedulers" that inadvertently mismatch methods. They see no immediate compiler errors, only unexpected runtime results.  
   - **Debrief**: You reintroduce the concept of "compiler-enforced contracts." Show how an interface solves it.

2. **Activity B: Interface Creation Based on a Recipe**  
   - **Goal**: Provide them with a partial Design Recipe (Step 1: Data definitions, Step 2: Method signatures). Let them create an interface from it and enforce it across multiple classes.  
   - **Outcome**: Students see how the interface is effectively a direct translation of Step 2's method signature.

3. **Scaffolding & Chunking**  
   - Introduce the interface in small steps:
     - Step 1: Write the interface alone (one method).  
     - Step 2: Implement it in a single class.  
     - Step 3: Show passing the interface type to a method.  
     - Step 4: Add a second class that also implements the interface, emphasizing reusability.

> **Why This Reduces Cognitive Load**: Each step is clear, has a small scope, and builds on the previous. Students can fully absorb one concept before layering on the next.

---

### **6. Potential Pitfalls & Best Practices**

1. **Common Pitfalls**  
   - **Overloading vs. Overriding**: *"If you change the parameter list, it's not implementing the interface method—compiler error."*  
   - **Forgetting `@Override`**: *"Though optional, it's best practice. If you misspell the method signature, `@Override` reveals it immediately."*  
   - **Mixing up `implements` with `extends`**: *"Remember: classes `implements` interfaces; classes `extends` other classes."*

2. **Design Recipe Pitfalls**  
   - *"If your interface is too vague, you lose clarity. Make sure your Step 2 (Method Signature & Purpose) is carefully thought out—if you have `void doSomething();`, it's not as helpful or self-explanatory."*

3. **Best Practices**  
   - **Use descriptive interface names** (e.g., `Scheduler`, `Playable`, `Drawable`).  
   - **Document interface methods** (Javadoc references the required preconditions and postconditions).  
   - **Keep method sets minimal** (only what each implementor truly needs; avoid interface bloat).

---

### **7. Conclusion & Transition to Section 4**

1. **Final Recap**  
   - *"Interfaces ensure the method signatures you define in your Design Recipe are compiled into code as enforceable contracts. This fosters correctness, type safety, and reusability. You no longer rely on human diligence alone—Java's compiler helps."*

2. **Preview of Standard Interfaces**  
   - *"Next, we'll see how to leverage built-in interfaces like `Comparable` and `Iterable`. We'll examine how Java uses them to force certain patterns (e.g., ensuring a `compareTo()` exists) or to allow features like the enhanced `for` loop. The same principle applies: the interface is a promise that the compiler can enforce."*

---

## **Section 4: Common Library Interfaces (Comparable, Iterable, etc.)**

### **Example 1: `Comparable<T>`**  

1. **Sorting**  
   - Show how implementing `Comparable<Person>` with `public int compareTo(Person other)` lets you do `Collections.sort(...)`.  
   - Emphasize the compiler ensures your signature is `compareTo(Person)`, not `compare(Person)` or some mismatch.

2. **Pitfalls**  
   - Return from `compareTo` must indicate negative/0/positive. If you skip that or do it incorrectly, you get weird sorting or compile-time signature errors.

### **Example 2: `Iterable<T>`**  

1. **Foreach & `iterator()`**  
   - Tie it back to your custom iteration logic from an earlier chapter if you like.  
   - Show that implementing `Iterable<T>` means you must have `public Iterator<T> iterator()`.  
   - Once done, your class can be used in `for (T item : yourObject)` loops. The compiler checks that `iterator()` is present and typed properly.

### **Exercises**  

- *Implement `Comparable<Student>` to sort by GPA.*  
- *Create a custom data structure that `implements Iterable<MyData>`, returning a real `Iterator<MyData>` inside.*  

### **Conclusion**  

- Summarize: *"We saw how the compiler enforces these standard interfaces. Without a proper `compareTo`, your code won't compile if you claim to be `Comparable`."*

---

## **Additional Suggestions & Improvements**

1. **Short "Off-Ramp" to Full Docs**  
   - At the end of each section on standard exceptions or interfaces, you might include: *"For advanced usage, check the official Java docs in `java.lang` or `java.util`."*  
   - This helps students know where to find deeper references if needed.

2. **Tidy Up the "java.lang" Explanation**  
   - In Section 2, you can do a small call-out:  
     - **"`java.lang` is auto-imported—stuff like `String`, `System`, `Throwable` all live there."**  
     - **"Other packages you might need: `java.io` for I/O, `java.util` for collections, etc."**  
   - This clarifies the standard library structure without derailing the main story.

3. **Keep "Common Pitfalls" or "Sidebar"**  
   - Your chapters often highlight typical mistakes. Retain that approach in each of these four sections:
     - **Exceptions**: swallowing exceptions, empty catch blocks, catching everything.  
     - **Interfaces**: forgetting or mismatching method signatures, mixing up "implements" with "extends," incorrectly naming your type parameter.  

4. **Exercises with Real-Worldish Tasks**  
   - For the interface part, you can have them:
     - Implement a small `Scheduler` interface with `schedule(Task t)`.  
     - Provide two classes that handle scheduling differently.  
     - The compiler ensures each class has that `schedule()` method.  
   - For exceptions, maybe let them do a "fake read from a file" example, or a "login method" that throws `InvalidCredentialException` if credentials fail.

5. **Transitions**  
   - Make sure you tie Section 1 to Section 2 by saying: *"Now that we know how to throw, let's see the standard exceptions we can throw—and see how Java's compiler demands we handle some of them."*  
   - Then tie Section 3 to 4 by: *"Now that we know how to define an interface, let's see how Java's built-in ones (like `Comparable` and `Iterable`) help us write consistent, compile-time-checked code with minimal hassle."*

### **In Short**  

Your (and your TA's) four-part structure is already well-aligned with how you taught strings or iteration:  

1. **A storyline** (the sentinel fiasco) leading to **throw** and **try/catch**.  
2. **A deeper look at library exceptions** (checked vs. unchecked, the compiler's role).  
3. **Introducing interfaces** as "contracts, not recipes," focusing on how the compiler ensures correctness.  
4. **Showcasing standard library interfaces** like `Comparable` and `Iterable`, with code that illustrates compiler demands and real utility.

By weaving in short narrative hooks, bullet-lists of pitfalls, code demos, small "check your understanding" quizzes, and end-of-section exercises—just as you do with strings—you'll keep everything consistent with your existing textbook approach.
